  about: "Hi! I am Stefano Grasso. Since July 2022 I work as a Multiplexed Synthetic Biology Scientist in the newly established Biofoundry of Lesaffre in Lille, France. Until May 2022, I was Post-doc at the Centro de Biotecnología y Genómica de Plantas (CBGP) within the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM). From 2015 to 2020 I was a Marie Curie fellow within the ITN project ProteinFactory, and a PhD student at UMCG (Groningen University, NL) and DSM Food Specialties B.V. (Delft, NL). I obtained my MSc in Plant and Animal Biotechnology in 2015 at University of Udine and my BSc in Biotechnology in 2013 at the same University. In parallel to University, I was also a student of Scuola Superiore dell'Università degli Studi di Udine, an institute of excellence for highly talented students. Students had to obtain an outstanding GPA (at least 90%), follow extra courses, and produce two small theses per year. The School also provided full board and lodging. During University, I was an elected member of the Faculty Council and later served as elected student member of the Academic Senate. I also represented the Scuola Superiore within the network of Italian Excellence Institutes. In my free time I like to travel and cook, applying the same principles I use in the lab.",
  consulting: "I offer tailored solutions in biotechnology and bioinformatics (both wet- and dry-lab). I can assist in wet-lab work while considering all other aspects, and provide advice for in silico projects with experimental context in mind. Services include: design and development of custom tools and software for prediction and analysis, support in designing and implementing wet- and dry-lab projects, guidance for setting up new Molecular Biology, Synthetic Biology, or Biofoundry labs, courses on online/offline bioinformatics tools and databases, and team assembly for projects outside my expertise. Contact me to discuss; quotes are free and non-binding.",
  research_interests: "My research interests focus on fusing bioinformatics and biotechnology, currently called Synthetic Biology. Main interests include protein secretion, strain development and optimization, protein analyses and annotation, genomic annotation, comparative proteomic and genomic analyses, development of prediction tools, synthetic biology and genetic engineering. I have broad technical and scientific knowledge and experience across molecular biology, molecular genetics, proteomics, and bioinformatics in species ranging from bacteria to plants. I am also interested in hardware, automation, and open hardware. I can lead projects from drafting, design, customization, implementation, execution, analysis, and dissemination.",
  software: "GP4 (Gram-Positive Protein Prediction Pipeline) is a protein subcellular localization meta-prediction tool for Gram+ Bacteria implementing an expert system predictor.
